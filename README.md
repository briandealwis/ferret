# Ferret: A Software Exploration Tool

![A little ferret](site/src/main/resources/XenoFerret.jpg)

Ferret is a software exploration tool.  Ferret has sometimes been
described as "Eclipse Search on steroids."

Ferret is an Eclipse view that provides a structured display of
information describing how one or more program elements are situated
in the context of the system.

![Ferret in action](site/src/main/resources/doc/ferret-demo.png)

This context is computed automatically as the program elements are
selected in the IDE (label 1), and is structured as answers to a set of
_conceptual queries_ about those elements.  These conceptual
queries are intended to closely match the types of questions
developers actually want to answer.

Ferret's conceptual queries include and build-on the standard
queries supported by Eclipse. 
These conceptual queries include queries such as:

  - Where is this method called?
  - What methods return objects of this type?
  - Where are objects of this type instantiated?
  - What interfaces define (or specify) this method?
  - What implementations are there of this interface method?
  - What are the other alternative implementations of this method in
    the hierarchy?

The conceptual queries are categorized by whether they involve
_declarations_, are about _inter-class_ or _intra-class_
relations, or are _hierarchical_ in nature.

The results of queries may be clustered by their different
attributes (labels 2), as selected by the programmer.  For
example: the instantiators of a type (a class or the classes
implementing an interface), which are typically methods, may be clustered
into different groups identified by attributes such as their
their containing type,
their containing type's package (as shown above),
their access protection (public, private, package, or default),
or boolean attributes such as static vs non-static.

More notable is that Ferret's conceptual
queries can make use of different sources of program information,
such as the static relations embedded in the source code, the
dynamic runtime information recorded in a TPTP trace, and
plugin details as defined in `plugin.xml` and `MANIFEST.MF`.
Thus dynamic runtime information can be used to replace
some of the statically-derived relations, transforming the questions
above to "Where are objects of this type _actually_ instantiated?"
or "Where is this method _actually_ called?"  Establishing
correspondances between elements from different sources of program
information may not be exact, tracked as the _fidelity_ of the
correspondance and propagated through the queries.

The Ferret documentation ships with the plugin, and is also available 
[online](http://manumitting.com/tools/eclipse/ferret/stable/doc/) too.

## Notes

Kenyon was a research project to index Subversion repositories.  It died
a long time ago and the Kenyon binding has since been disabled.  It's
entirely possible that we could rewrite some of its support for JGit.

The Eclipse Testing and Profiling tools project (TPTP) was archived in
May 2016 and the TPTP binding has since been disabled.  Suggestions for
tracing libraries with a nice API are appreciated!

## Installation

Ferret is an Eclipse plug-in and requires Eclipse 4.6 (Neon) or
later.  To install, use the following update site:
