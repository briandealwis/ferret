<H2>About Ferret</H2>

<P>Ferret is a software exploration tool that provides a automatic
structured display of information about the <EM>local context</EM>
of a program element of interest.  The local context of an element
is the set of relations between the element and the rest of the
system.  Ferret structures the local context as answers to a set
of <EM>conceptual queries</EM> about that element.
Examples of conceptual queries include:</P>
<UL>
    <LI> What methods return objects of this type?
    <LI> What interfaces does this class implement?
    <LI> When was this element last changed?
    <LI> What plugins depend on this plugin?
    <LI> What methods actually instantiated objects of this type? 
</UL>
<P>These conceptual queries include and build-on the standard queries
supported by Eclipse.</P>

<P>Ferret's underlying model supports integrating different sources
of program information,
to provide better answers to conceptual queries. 
<!--
    so queries can benefit from -- or require -- knowledge
    beyond the relations expressed in the static source code. 
-->
For example, dynamic runtime program traces describe the operations
<EM>actually</EM> executed, and can be used to refine the relations
expressed by in the static source code.
Eclipse's plugin architecture supports decoupling of components by
expressing the coupling relations in the <code>plugin.xml</code>
manifests; integrating support for these displayed couplings supports
relating program elements by other than than just static code relations.
