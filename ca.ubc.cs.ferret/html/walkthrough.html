<LI> <P>If the Dossier is not already present, push the <CODE>F9</CODE> key. 
    The Dossier view should pop up and be populated with a set of
    queries.  When the queries are finished, which should take a few
    seconds, you should see a view like this:</P>
    <div align="center"><img src="Ferret-figure.png"></div>
    </LI>
<LI>  <P>Try expanding some of the tree elements, such as for the query
    <CODE>superinterfaces</CODE>, showing the super interfaces specified
    by <CODE>Figure</CODE>.  Right-click on the first result for this query,
    <CODE>Cloneable</CODE>: the normal Java operations are available from
    this elements.</P></LI>
<LI> <P>The query <CODE>implementors</CODE> has many results (44), however
    Ferret was able to find 3 different means of grouping these results.
    To access these groupings, right click on the element, and choose
    the <CODE>Cluster results by...</CODE> menu.</P>
    <div align="center"><img src="Ferret-figure-cluster.png"></div>
    <P>Choose to cluster by the enclosing package: to cluster the results
    by their package.</P></LI>
<LI> <P>Now click on the re-open original query element button
    <IMG SRC="nav_home.gif" title="[reopen original query element]">. 
    This causes the original queried-upon element <CODE>Figure</CODE>
    to be re-opened.</P></LI>
<LI> <P>Try selecting the <CODE>Figure.decompose()</CODE> method from
    the <CODE>Outline</CODE> view, and notice the <CODE>Dossier</CODE>'s
    contents have changed with the query results about the new
    element.</P>
